# PHP Hello World

This project consists of a classic hello world program written in the PHP language. A refresh has been made recently on the PHP programming language and the first thing done during this refreshing session/marathon was this hello world program.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

In order to run this project, an application server that supports PHP is the only thing necessary. Links for further instructions on installation for each operating system are below:

* [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/setup.html)
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
* [MAMP](https://documentation.mamp.info/)
* [LAMP](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer)


### Installing

No installation is required for the project itself. The only thing that should be installed is the application server mentioned above. Once the application server is installed, clone the project to a local folder on your machine:

With HTTPS

```
git clone https://github.com/DavidGuimaraes/php-hello-world.git
```

Or using SSH

```
git clone git@github.com:DavidGuimaraes/php-hello-world.git
```


## Deployment

Deployment depends on the application server used. On this case, XAMPP was used on the macOS. If this is your case, move the cloned folder to your htdocs folder or clone the project directly in you htdocs folder.


## Built With
